- Removed MutationObserver on document. With it removed connected/disconnected errors

- Allow `on-click` etc. instead of `onclick`

- All event-names are lowercased (TBC)

- By default, the attributes are actually set as properties (``node[name] = value``). Add a '$' to opt-in to attribute setting (``node.setAttribute(name, value)``). (polymer-style).

    <p class$=${'big'}></p> vs. <p className=${'big'}></p>

    But <input value=${''} /> just works.

- Removed hyperHTML.Component bc it belongs to a separate project.

- Add Observable support (RxJS) as a primitive type for nodes and attribute parts.

- Use importNode instead of cloneNode for better interop with custom elements

- Remove a-frame hack

- Make strings preprocessing faster

- Early remove attributes (before cloning) for interop with custom elements

- Remove `wire(obj, ':adopt')` bc it was really dirty

- Do NOT treat arrays of primitive values (like strings) as html, just `join('')` them

- Add html`` and svg`` functions which will be lazy evaluated during render.

- Remove this-es and in general refactor the caching system

- Removed `hyperHTML.escape`
